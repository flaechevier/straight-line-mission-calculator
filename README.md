# straight-line-mission-calculator
Program to calculate different scores for a straight line mission (see https://www.youtube.com/c/GeoWizard).
The program prvides different metrices to measure the success of a straight line mission:
-> total area between the straight line and the actual route
-> mean deviation ("area" / "length of the straight line")
-> Mean squared error (to punish bigger deviations from the line)
-> Maximum deviation
-> percentage of time spend outside the thresholds 10m, 25m, 50m, 80m and 120m
-> A chart visualizing the deviations from the line
